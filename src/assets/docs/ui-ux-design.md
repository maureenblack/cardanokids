# Cardano Kids UI/UX Design Guidelines

## Design Philosophy

The Cardano Kids platform is designed with a child-friendly, engaging, and educational approach. The interface uses Cardano's color palette (blues and greens) with brighter, more vibrant variations appropriate for children. The design prioritizes accessibility, intuitive navigation, and age-appropriate content delivery.

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- **Cardano Blue**: #0033AD - Primary brand color from the Cardano logo
- **Cardano Light Blue**: #4D6FFF - Lighter variation of the primary color
- **Cardano Dark Blue**: #001F7A - Darker variation of the primary color
- **Vibrant Orange**: #FF5722 - Secondary brand color for contrast and engagement
- **Warning Yellow**: #FFC107 - Accent color for important elements and highlights
- **Success Green**: #4CAF50 - Used for success states and completion indicators
- **Info Blue**: #2196F3 - Used for informational elements and tooltips

### Age Group Color Coding
